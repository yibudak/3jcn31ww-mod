3JCN31WW BIOS Firmware For SPI Programmer

** ONLY FOR LENOVO IDEAPAD 310/510 - 14/15IKB **

This is the last firmware extracted from Insyde's flasher. The file had some verify and update parameters and wasn't suitable for flashing. I have adjusted the firmware with my own BIOS dump so you can flash this file through any SPI programmer. If you are a lucky guy that forgot the BIOS password like me, this could be your medicine. :)

The BIOS chip was named "25864CS1G". This is one of the Winbond's 8MByte/64MBit serial flash memory ICs. I used CH341A as programmer and flashed it in "W25Q64FW" category. Also don't forget that you will need a SOP8 crocodile and remove battery/BIOS battery before flashing.
